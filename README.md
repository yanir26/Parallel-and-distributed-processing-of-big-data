# Parallel-and-distributed-processing-of-big-data

In this project we will use map reduce to analyze big data in parallel and distributed systems with erlang.

Graphviz must be installed on the computers:

```sudo apt install graphviz ```

For conversion xml to csv we used ```dblp-to-csv``` github.
